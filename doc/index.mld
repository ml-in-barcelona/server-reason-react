{0 server-reason-react}

This is the documentation and API for {{:https://github.com/ml-in-barcelona/server-reason-react}server-reason-react}, an implementation of [react], [react-dom] and [react-dom/server] to run on the server with {{:https://reasonml.github.io/}Reason}/{{:https://ocaml.org/}OCaml}, with the purpose to Server-side render HTML markup from a {{:https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react//}reason-react} application natively (for both SSR and SSG).

{0 Why}

Explained more about the motivation in this blog post {{:https://sancho.dev/blog/server-side-rendering-react-in-ocaml}sancho.dev/blog/server-side-rendering-react-in-ocaml} and also in my talk about {{:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3qY-Eg9zRY&ab_channel=ReactAlicante}Server side rendering React natively with Reason} at ReactAlicante 2023.

{1 Core API}

Those are the core libraries of [server-reason-react].

{!modules: react reactDom}

{1 Other libraries}

Aside from the core, [server-reason-react] exposes some needed known libraries from melange or melange-community to help make components universal:

{ul
  {li {!Belt} [server-reason-react.belt] (equivalent to [Belt] from [melange])}
  {li {!Js} [server-reason-react.js] (equivalent to [Js] from [melange], very unsafe)}
  {li {!URL} [server-reason-react.url]}
  {li {!Webapi} [server-reason-react.webapi] (equivalent to [Webapi] from [melange-webapi])}
}

{_ This would eventually be extracted into their own packages}
